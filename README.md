This is the data set for my build week. I used the sports-reference api to pull data from [pro football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com). 

This api was created by Robert Clark, please visit his [profile and blog on medium](https://medium.com/clarktech-sports/python-sports-analytics-made-simple-part-2-40e591a7f3db
) for further reference.
